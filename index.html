            <article>
            <p>Hi hi! My name is MK Bramer! I am a student located in Cheney, WA, attending Eastern Washington University. 
                My major is Visual Communication Design with a minor in Creative Writing! 
                I chose the VCD major because I love the creative problem-solving aspect 
                of the graphic design field, and I have been obsessed with visual media 
                since before I can remember. From books, movies, TV, videogames, to comics 
                and art galleries--if it’s visually interesting I’m all about it! My dream 
                is to create book cover designs, as it combines both of my greatest passions in a fun and niche way! </p>

                <p>I have 2 cats, Bucky & Goomba! I’ve had Bucky since I was 18, and me and my partner just got Goomba in November of 2023. Some other things I enjoy include goth music (music of any genre, really), drawing, video games, and camping! </p>
                
                <p>I love design, I love getting to solve creative problems and come out with something I’m proud of by the end of the process! </p>
                
                <p>Bye bye!</p>
